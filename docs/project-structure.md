# Project Structure Summary

- **Repository Type:** Monolith backend service (single Express application)
- **Primary Language:** TypeScript targeting Node.js 20+
- **Package Manager:** pnpm (see `packageManager` field in `package.json`)
- **Build Output:** `dist/` generated by `tsc -p tsconfig.json`
- **Stateful Storage:** `better-auth.sqlite` (SQLite database created at runtime)

## Key Directories

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/` | Application source code, including the Express server (`server.ts`), Better Auth wiring (`auth.ts`), and unit tests under `__tests__/`. |
| `scripts/` | Utility scripts used during development and smoke checks (for example `check-discovery.mjs`). |
| `docs/` | Generated BMAD documentation and workflow state artifacts. |
| `bmad/` | BMAD workflow definitions, tasks, and templates bundled with the repo. |
| `dist/` | Transpiled JavaScript generated by the build pipeline. |

## Entry Points & Runtime Contracts

- Application entry point: `src/server.ts` (compiled to `dist/server.js`).
- Better Auth configuration and adapters: `src/auth.ts`.
- HTTP server created through `createApp()` and started via the default export in `src/server.ts`.
- Test coverage executed through `pnpm test` (Node test runner over files in `src/__tests__/`).

## Tooling & Commands

- `pnpm dev` — runs `tsx watch src/server.ts` for hot-reload development.
- `pnpm build` — emits production JavaScript bundles into `dist/`.
- `pnpm start` — runs the compiled server (`node dist/server.js`).
- `pnpm auth:generate` / `pnpm auth:migrate` — Better Auth CLI workflows for schema handling.
- `pnpm smoke:discovery` — quick health check of the MCP discovery endpoint.

## Observations

- No frontend/UI bundle is present; this service exposes HTTP endpoints and authentication flows only.
- Tests rely on Node's built-in test runner plus `supertest` for HTTP assertions.
- Configuration is environment-driven via `dotenv`; no framework-specific configuration directories were detected.
