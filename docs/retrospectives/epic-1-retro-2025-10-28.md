# Epic 1 Retrospective – Central MCP Compatibility Alignment

## Epic Snapshot
- **Epic Goal:** Deliver MCP-compatible registry, OAuth/session services, and compliance automation so ChatGPT MCP clients integrate without bespoke glue.
- **Completion Date:** 2025-10-28
- **Stories Delivered:**
  - 1.1 Establish MCP registry and metadata (5 pts, done 2025-10-24)
  - 1.2 Align OAuth + MCP session endpoints (5 pts, done 2025-10-28)
  - 1.3 Automate MCP compliance verification (3 pts, done 2025-10-25)
- **Story Points:** 13 planned / 13 delivered (100%)

## Delivery Metrics
### Scope & Throughput
- Stories planned: 3 · Stories completed: 3 (100%)
- Velocity: 13 pts over the epic window (approx. 1.5 sprints)
- Blockers resolved: 1 (scope sanitization issue caught in AI review)

### Quality Gates
- Contract and regression suites (`pnpm test`) executed for every story completion.
- MCP compliance harness validated against multi-client fixtures and session edge cases.
- Documentation parity test (README vs integration checklist) keeps operator guidance in sync.

## What Worked Well
- **Incremental layering:** Registry (Story 1.1) unlocked contract enforcement in 1.2 and automation in 1.3 without rework.
- **Shared schema & fixtures:** Centralised Zod schemas and test factories reduced duplication and boosted confidence in multi-client coverage.
- **Automated guardrails:** CLI compliance script plus README/doc parity test prevented documentation drift and future regressions.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
- **Scope sanitisation gap:** OAuth proxy originally forwarded unfiltered scopes; addressed in Story 1.2 follow-up and guarded by regression `1.2-API-007`. → Lesson: run enforcement-relaxed scenarios early, not just the default strict path.
- **Documentation drift risk:** README vs checklist divergence surfaced during Story 1.3. → Lesson: keep doc-parity tests close to source or expand linting in future epics.
- **Operator readiness:** Compliance tooling existed, but onboarding steps (secrets, staging URLs) were implicit. → Lesson: produce an explicit runbook before onboarding external partners.

## Action Items
| ID | Description | Owner | Due | Tracking |
| -- | ----------- | ----- | --- | -------- |
| AI-1 | Wire the MCP compliance CLI into CI (staging + main) so regressions block deploys | Platform DevOps | Next sprint | Backlog (2025-10-28) |
| AI-2 | Draft MCP onboarding runbook (env vars, compliance steps, rollback guidance) for operators | Auth Ops | Next sprint | Backlog (2025-10-28) |

## Preparation for Next Epic
- **Next Epic:** Not yet defined. Recommend formalising Epic 2 scope (e.g., partner onboarding or consent UX) before sprint planning.
- **Dependencies on Epic 1:**
  - Compliance harness must run in CI (AI-1) to guard future changes.
  - Operator runbook (AI-2) needed so support teams can onboard new MCP clients.
- **Readiness:** Codebase stable; registry + compliance scripts deployed to dev. Production rollout contingent on staging CI hook and ops documentation.

## Critical Path Before Next Epic
1. Land CI compliance job (AI-1) and confirm it gates staging/prod deploys.
2. Publish the MCP onboarding runbook (AI-2) and circulate to Ops + Support.
3. Validate production environment secrets (e.g., `MCP_COMPLIANCE_CLIENT_SECRET`) ahead of the next integration cycle.

## Validation Checklist
- **Testing Complete:** Yes – `pnpm test` (full suite) and targeted compliance suites executed across stories 1.1–1.3.
- **Deployment Status:** Dev/staging ready; production deployment pending once CI gate is active.
- **Business Validation:** Product/Operator stakeholders reviewed compliance tooling and documentation; additional runbook requested (AI-2).
- **Technical Health:** Codebase stable with shared schemas, reusable fixtures, and automated docs/tests; no outstanding production bugs.
- **Blocker Resolution:** No unresolved blockers. Critical follow-ups captured in action items above.

## Story Outcomes (Appendix)
- **Story 1.1:** Established MCP registry, metadata endpoints, and operator checklist. All ACs met; review approved 2025-10-24.
- **Story 1.2:** Normalised OAuth/token/introspection/session flows; sanitised scope forwarding; regression coverage added. Completed 2025-10-28.
- **Story 1.3:** Shipped compliance CLI, documentation parity tests, and CI hook guidance. Completed 2025-10-25.
