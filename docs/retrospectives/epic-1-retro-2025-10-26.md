# Epic 1 Retrospective – Central MCP Compatibility Alignment

## Epic Snapshot
- **Epic Goal:** Deliver MCP-compatible registry, OAuth/session services, CI guardrails, and operator guidance so MCP clients integrate without bespoke glue.
- **Completion Date:** 2025-10-26
- **Stories Delivered:**
  - 1.1 Establish MCP registry and metadata (5 pts, done 2025-10-24)
  - 1.2 Align OAuth + MCP session endpoints (5 pts, done 2025-10-28)
  - 1.3 Automate MCP compliance verification (3 pts, done 2025-10-25)
  - 1.4 Enforce MCP compliance checks in CI (3 pts, done 2025-10-26)
  - 1.5 Publish MCP onboarding runbook (2 pts, done 2025-10-25)
- **Story Points:** 18 planned / 18 delivered (100%)

## Delivery Metrics
### Scope & Throughput
- Stories planned: 5 · Stories completed: 5 (100%)
- Velocity: 18 pts delivered over ~2 sprint increments (avg ≈ 9 pts / sprint)
- Blockers resolved: 2 (scope sanitisation gap in Story 1.2; compliance CLI grant omission in Story 1.4)

### Quality Gates
- Regression suites (`pnpm test`) executed for each story hand-off.
- MCP compliance harness (`pnpm mcp:compliance`) validated staging, loopback, and production base URLs multiple times.
- Documentation parity check kept README, integration checklist, and runbook aligned.

## What Worked Well
- **Layered delivery:** Registry → contract enforcement → automation → CI → runbook built sequential confidence without rework.
- **Automation guardrails:** Compliance CLI in CI blocked regressions immediately; local scripts made validation repeatable.
- **Documentation cadence:** README, checklist, and runbook stayed in sync thanks to parity tests and quick feedback cycles.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
- **Scope sanitisation gap:** OAuth proxy initially forwarded unfiltered scopes. Lesson: include negative-path tests early so enforcement bugs surface before production.
- **CLI grant edge case:** Compliance CLI skipped session challenge whenever `client_credentials` was absent. Lesson: keep defensive assertions even when protocols omit optional flows.
- **Operator guidance drift:** Prior documentation buried onboarding steps. Lesson: consolidate operational knowledge in a dedicated runbook and keep it source-controlled.

## Action Items
| ID | Description | Owner | Due | Tracking |
| -- | ----------- | ----- | --- | -------- |
| AI-4 | Automate README ↔ runbook parity check via lint to prevent future doc divergence | Platform DevOps | 2025-11-12 | Backlog |

## Preparation for Next Epic
- **Next Epic:** Not yet defined; candidates include partner onboarding or consent UX enhancements.
- **Dependencies on Epic 1:** CI compliance gate and onboarding runbook now live; both must remain healthy before scaling integrations.
- **Readiness:** Codebase stable, secrets provisioned, CI passing. Define Epic 2 scope before committing new work.

## Critical Path Before Next Epic
1. Finalise Epic 2 charter and success metrics.
2. Review production secret rotation cadence to ensure runbook stays accurate.

## Validation Checklist
- **Testing Complete:** Yes – `pnpm test` and targeted compliance suites executed across all stories.
- **Deployment Status:** Dev/staging aligned; CI gate active; production rollout ready pending nightly job automation.
- **Business Validation:** Stakeholder needs (registry, CI gate, runbook) satisfied; solo maintainer verified outputs.
- **Technical Health:** Codebase uses shared schemas/fixtures; docs and CI guardrails keep drift low.
- **Blocker Resolution:** No unresolved blockers; new action items captured above.

## Story Outcomes (Appendix)
- **Story 1.1:** Established MCP registry, metadata endpoints, and operator checklist. Review approved 2025-10-24.
- **Story 1.2:** Normalised OAuth/token/introspection/session flows; sanitised scope forwarding; regression tests added. Completed 2025-10-28.
- **Story 1.3:** Delivered compliance CLI, docs parity tests, and CI guidance. Completed 2025-10-25.
- **Story 1.4:** Added CI compliance job, restored session challenge assertion, updated docs. Completed 2025-10-26.
- **Story 1.5:** Published onboarding runbook with environment matrix, compliance guidance, and rollback steps for solo operations. Completed 2025-10-25.
