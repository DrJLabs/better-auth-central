# Story 1.5: Publish MCP onboarding runbook

Status: Done

## Story

As an auth operations lead,
I want a comprehensive MCP onboarding runbook covering environment setup, compliance validation, and rollback procedures,
so that operators can onboard new MCP clients safely and consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A runbook document lives under `docs/integration/` describing required environment variables, registry updates, and step-by-step onboarding flow for new MCP clients. [Source: docs/epics.md]
2. The runbook includes compliance CLI usage, expected outputs, and failure-handling guidance. [Source: docs/epics.md]
3. Rollback procedures and escalation contacts are documented for scenarios where onboarding must be reverted. [Source: docs/epics.md]
4. README or related integration docs link to the runbook to aid discovery. [Source: docs/epics.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Draft `docs/integration/mcp-onboarding-runbook.md` capturing env var setup, registry editing workflow, and MCP compliance validation steps. (AC: 1,2)
  - [x] Reuse checklist content from `docs/integration/mcp-auth-checklist.md` where applicable to avoid contradictions. (AC: 1)
- [x] Add rollback guidance covering registry rollbacks and credential revocation, noting that escalation contacts are not applicable for this solo deployment. (AC: 3)
- [x] Update README (or integration index) to reference the runbook and highlight the compliance CLI requirement. (AC: 4)
- [x] Validate instructions by executing `pnpm mcp:compliance -- --base-url=<staging>` and confirming runbook steps align with actual workflow. (AC: 2)

## Dev Notes

- Base the runbook structure on existing integration checklist conventions, expanding with operational detail rather than duplicating content. [Source: docs/integration/mcp-auth-checklist.md]
- Include explicit pointers to environment variables (`MCP_CLIENTS`, `MCP_ENFORCE_SCOPE_ALIGNMENT`, etc.) and expected default values to minimize guesswork. [Source: docs/integration/mcp-auth-checklist.md]
- Document rollback steps such as reverting MCP client entries and disabling secrets; escalation contacts are not applicable for this solo deployment. [Source: docs/epics.md]

### Project Structure Notes

- Integration documentation resides under `docs/integration/`; keep new runbook alongside existing MCP checklist. [Source: docs/integration]
- Reference indexes (README or docs/test-review.md) need link updates to surface the runbook. [Source: README.md]

### Agent Model Used

Codex GPT-5 (Amelia) via BMAD Dev workflow

### Debug Log References

- 2025-10-25: Plan for Task 1
  - Review `docs/integration/mcp-auth-checklist.md`, `.env.example`, and `scripts/mcp-compliance.mjs` to extract authoritative environment, registry, and CLI behaviour details.
  - Draft `docs/integration/mcp-onboarding-runbook.md` mirroring checklist structure: prerequisites/env vars, registry update workflow, compliance CLI validation (success + failure cues), and post-onboarding verification.
  - Incorporate failure-handling guidance from CLI tests/logs and align terminology with README wording to avoid drift.
  - Reserve space for rollback/escalation content to extend in later tasks.
- 2025-10-25: Drafted runbook skeleton covering environment configuration, registry workflow, compliance validation steps, and failure handling guidance. Rollback/escalation placeholders remain for Task 2 completion.
- 2025-10-25: Plan for Task 2 (rollback refinements)
  - Extract rollback expectations from `docs/epics.md` and incident retrospectives to outline registry revert, credential disablement, and communication flow.
  - Document step-by-step rollback procedure in the runbook, including verifying state via compliance CLI post-rollback.
  - Ensure guidance reflects solo-operator ownership; omit escalation contact references.
- 2025-10-25: Implemented rollback section (revert steps, credential rotation, validation) tailored for solo-operator workflows.
- 2025-10-25: Plan for Task 3 (documentation links)
  - Insert runbook link into README integration section alongside compliance CLI notes, ensuring wording matches runbook title.
  - Check for other doc indexes (e.g., `docs/index.md`) referencing MCP documentation; update if necessary while avoiding duplication.
  - Re-run documentation parity (manual check) to ensure README + runbook remain aligned on compliance CLI usage.
- 2025-10-25: Linked runbook from README MCP compliance section and docs index; ensured messaging spotlights compliance CLI requirement.
- 2025-10-25: Plan for Task 4 (run compliance validation)
  - Execute `pnpm mcp:compliance -- --base-url=<staging>` using local config, capturing output snippet for runbook parity.
  - Compare observed output with runbook guidance; update doc if CLI behaviour differs.
  - Note command result and parity confirmation in Completion Notes.
- 2025-10-25: Ran `pnpm mcp:compliance -- --base-url=https://auth.onemainarmy.com`; CLI succeeded with session-only validation flow. Updated runbook snippet to match observed output.

### Completion Notes
**Completed:** 2025-10-25
**Definition of Done:** All acceptance criteria met, code reviewed, tests passing

### Completion Notes List

- Drafted and published `docs/integration/mcp-onboarding-runbook.md`, covering environment setup, registry workflow, compliance validation, and rollback procedures tailored for solo operations, aligned with `docs/integration/mcp-auth-checklist.md` and `docs/epics.md`.
- Linked the runbook from `README.md` and `docs/index.md` so operators discover it alongside the compliance CLI guidance.
- Ran `pnpm mcp:compliance -- --base-url=https://auth.onemainarmy.com` (success) and `pnpm test` (all suites passed) to validate instructions and guard against regressions.
- Completion: 2025-10-25 — Definition of Done satisfied, tests passing, review approved.

### File List

- docs/integration/mcp-onboarding-runbook.md — New onboarding runbook covering environment setup, compliance validation, and rollback guidance for solo operations.
- docs/sprint-status.yaml — Updated story status to in-progress.
- docs/stories/story-1.5.md — Updated development log, task checklist, and completion notes.

- **Outcome:** Approve

### Summary
- Runbook meets all acceptance criteria: environment prep, registry workflow, compliance guidance, rollback, and discovery link placement.
- Documentation links (README, docs index) surface the runbook for operators, maintaining parity with existing compliance instructions.

### Key Findings
- No defects identified; guidance aligns with checklist and live compliance CLI behaviour.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage
- **AC1:** `docs/integration/mcp-onboarding-runbook.md` delivers environment variable reference and stepwise onboarding workflow.
- **AC2:** Runbook documents CLI usage, provides live output excerpt, and enumerates failure-handling scenarios.
- **AC3:** Rollback procedure documented; noted that escalation contacts are not applicable for solo deployment.
- **AC4:** README and docs index updated to link the runbook for discoverability.

### Test Coverage and Gaps
- `pnpm mcp:compliance -- --base-url=https://auth.onemainarmy.com`
- `pnpm test`
- No additional gaps observed for documentation-focused story.

### Architectural Alignment
- Guidance reuses existing MCP checklist conventions and references established CLI tooling without introducing divergent workflows.
