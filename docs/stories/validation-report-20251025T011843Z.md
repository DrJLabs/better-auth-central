### Story Context Assembly Checklist
Pass Rate: 9/10 (90%)

✓ Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured  
Evidence: Persona statement populated under `<asA>`, `<iWant>`, and `<soThat>` (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:13-15).

✓ Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)  
Evidence: XML acceptance criteria mirror the story markdown bullets verbatim, including production command reference (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:25-29; docs/stories/story-central-mcp-compatibility-3.md:13-23).

✓ Tasks/subtasks captured as task list  
Evidence: Task checklist copied into `<tasks>` block with all five items preserved (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:16-21; docs/stories/story-central-mcp-compatibility-3.md:25-33).

✗ Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets  
Evidence: Only four documentation artifacts listed under `<docs>` (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:34-57), below the 5-item minimum required by the checklist.

✓ Relevant code references included with reason and line hints  
Evidence: Code artifacts enumerate CLI, tests, configuration, and env template with rationale and line spans (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:60-101).

✓ Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable  
Evidence: REST interfaces for discovery, handshake, session, token, and introspection endpoints documented with signatures (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:113-147).

✓ Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns  
Evidence: Constraint paragraph outlines registry reuse, origin enforcement, schema validation, and bearer challenge expectations (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:111-112).

✓ Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks  
Evidence: Node ecosystem dependency block highlights runtime (zod) and dev (TypeBox) contracts required for compliance tooling (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:103-107).

✓ Testing standards and locations populated  
Evidence: Tests section references CLI/ATDD suites, API contract location, and checklist alignment with detailed ideas per acceptance criteria (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:151-157).

✓ XML structure follows story-context template format  
Evidence: Document retains template ordering from metadata through tests with properly nested tags (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:1-160; bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/story-context/context-template.xml:1-40).

## Failed Items
- Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets — add at least one more authoritative document (e.g., architecture or operator guide updates) so the docs section covers 5-15 sources.

## Partial Items
None.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: Expand `<docs>` artifacts to include at least one additional authoritative reference (target 5-15 total) before marking the story context ready.
2. Should Improve: Revisit docs snippets after implementation to capture any new operational runbooks or CI configuration.
3. Consider: Once compliance CLI gains token/introspection validation, update context to reference the finalized Zod schema modules for future developers.
