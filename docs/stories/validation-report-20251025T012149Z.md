### Story Context Assembly Checklist
Pass Rate: 10/10 (100%)

✓ Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured  
Evidence: `<asA>`, `<iWant>`, and `<soThat>` reflect operator persona and outcome (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:13-15).

✓ Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)  
Evidence: Acceptance criteria bullets mirror the markdown story definition (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:25-29; docs/stories/story-central-mcp-compatibility-3.md:13-16).

✓ Tasks/subtasks captured as task list  
Evidence: Task checklist preserved as `<tasks>` entries (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:16-21; docs/stories/story-central-mcp-compatibility-3.md:20-24).

✓ Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets  
Evidence: Five authoritative documents captured, including README compliance section (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:34-63).  

✓ Relevant code references included with reason and line hints  
Evidence: Code artifacts enumerate CLI, tests, package scripts, env template, and README references with rationale (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:66-101).

✓ Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable  
Evidence: REST interfaces listed for discovery, handshake, session, token, and introspection endpoints with signatures (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:113-147).

✓ Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns  
Evidence: Constraint paragraph calls out registry reuse, origin enforcement, schema validation, and 401 handling requirements (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:111-112).

✓ Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks  
Evidence: Node ecosystem dependencies highlight zod/runtime and TypeBox/dev requirements (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:103-107).

✓ Testing standards and locations populated  
Evidence: Tests section points to CLI, ATDD, and contract suites plus ATDD checklist with actionable ideas (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:151-156).

✓ XML structure follows story-context template format  
Evidence: Document order matches template definition from metadata through tests (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.3.xml:1-160; bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/story-context/context-template.xml:1-40).

## Failed Items
None.

## Partial Items
None.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: None.
2. Should Improve: Re-run validation after implementation if additional references or dependencies are introduced.
3. Consider: Once the compliance CLI adds token/introspection schema enforcement, append corresponding module references to the code artifacts section.
