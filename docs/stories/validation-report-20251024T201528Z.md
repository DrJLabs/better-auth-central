### Story Context Assembly Checklist
Pass Rate: 10/10 (100%)

✓ Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured  
Evidence: Persona voice preserved in `asA`, `iWant`, `soThat` nodes (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:13-15).

✓ Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)  
Evidence: Acceptance criteria block mirrors markdown bullets 1:1 (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:19; docs/stories/story-central-mcp-compatibility-2.md:13-16).

✓ Tasks/subtasks captured as task list  
Evidence: Dev tasks joined into contextual `tasks` element (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:16) from story markdown checklist (docs/stories/story-central-mcp-compatibility-2.md:20-25).

✓ Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets  
Evidence: Six authoritative docs now referenced, including the new test design artifact (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:23-57).

✓ Relevant code references included with reason and line hints  
Evidence: Code section covers runtime modules plus new ATDD suite with rationale (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:62-90).

✓ Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable  
Evidence: REST interface entries enumerate token, introspection, session, and handshake signatures (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:118-138).

✓ Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns  
Evidence: Constraint paragraph highlights registry reuse, CORS enforcement, structured errors, and security alignment (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:104-107).

✓ Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks  
Evidence: Node ecosystem block lists runtime + dev packages (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:92-101).

✓ Testing standards and locations populated  
Evidence: Updated testing section points to ATDD checklist, new API suite, and compliance tooling with actionable ideas (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:143-149).

✓ XML structure follows story-context template format  
Evidence: Document retains template ordering (metadata → story → acceptanceCriteria → artifacts → constraints → interfaces → tests) per template definition (docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:1-150).

## Failed Items
None.

## Partial Items
None.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: None.
2. Should Improve: None.
3. Consider: After DEV implementation, rerun validation once ATDD suite flips green to keep documentation aligned with runtime behavior.
