Pass Rate: 10/10 (100%)

✓ Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured  
Evidence: Story persona and intent captured at docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:13-15, mirroring the story text at docs/stories/story-central-mcp-compatibility-2.md:7-9.

✓ Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)  
Evidence: Acceptance criteria block in docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:19 duplicates the four checklist items from docs/stories/story-central-mcp-compatibility-2.md:13-16.

✓ Tasks/subtasks captured as task list  
Evidence: Consolidated task string at docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:16 contains all six subtasks listed in docs/stories/story-central-mcp-compatibility-2.md:20-25.

✓ Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets  
Evidence: Five curated references under docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:23-52 cover epics, tech spec, integration checklist, product brief, and alignment checklist.

✓ Relevant code references included with reason and line hints  
Evidence: Code artifact entries at docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:55-88 enumerate server, auth, registry, metadata builder, and test modules with rationale and line ranges.

✓ Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable  
Evidence: Interfaces section at docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:93-126 documents handshake, session, token, and introspection endpoints with signatures and paths.

✓ Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns  
Evidence: Constraint block at docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:102 captures registry reuse, CORS enforcement, structured errors, and security alignment.

✓ Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks  
Evidence: Node ecosystem dependencies listed at docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:91-99 cite `better-auth`, `express`, `zod`, `@sinclair/typebox`, and `supertest`.

✓ Testing standards and locations populated  
Evidence: Testing section at docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:130-137 outlines standards, file locations, and idea prompts aligned to acceptance criteria.

✓ XML structure follows story-context template format  
Evidence: Document retains template ordering (metadata → story → acceptanceCriteria → artifacts → constraints → interfaces → tests) without structural deviations, per docs/stories/story-context-central-mcp-compatibility.2.xml:1-139.
