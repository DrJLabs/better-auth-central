# Story 1.4: Enforce MCP compliance checks in CI

Status: Done

## Story

As a Platform DevOps engineer,
I want GitHub Actions to run the MCP compliance CLI against staging and main environments,
so that MCP regressions block merges and deployments.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Actions executes `pnpm mcp:compliance` against staging and main base URLs for every pull request and `main` push, reusing existing Node/pnpm setup steps. [Source: docs/epics.md]
2. The compliance job fails the workflow when the CLI detects MCP contract violations, preventing deployments with regressions. [Source: docs/epics.md]
3. Pipeline documentation references the compliance check and explains how to rerun or debug failures. [Source: docs/epics.md]
4. Compliance job credentials and environment variables are sourced from GitHub secrets or reusable configuration without exposing sensitive data. [Source: docs/epics.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Extend `.github/workflows` to add an `mcp-compliance` job (or workflow) that runs `pnpm mcp:compliance -- --base-url=$STAGING_URL` and `--base-url=$MAIN_URL` after build steps. (AC: 1,2)
  - [x] Share dependency install/build cache with discovery smoke job to keep runtimes acceptable. (AC: 1)
- [x] Configure workflow secrets/environment variables for staging and main base URLs plus any client secrets required by the CLI. (AC: 1,4)
- [x] Update pipeline documentation (README CI section or new doc) with compliance check overview, rerun guidance, and failure triage steps. (AC: 3)
- [x] Validate locally by running `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm mcp:compliance -- --base-url=<staging>` to confirm exit codes mirror CI expectations. (AC: 2)

### Review Follow-ups (AI)

- [x] [AI-Review][Medium] Restore session endpoint challenge validation in `scripts/mcp-compliance.mjs` even when `grant_types_supported` omits `client_credentials` so AC2 still guards regressions (ref: scripts/mcp-compliance.mjs:222-225).

## Dev Notes

- Reuse existing GitHub Actions setup from `discovery-smoke.yml` to install dependencies and build artifacts before invoking the compliance CLI. [Source: .github/workflows/discovery-smoke.yml]
- Ensure the CLI waits for the local server or staging URL to be reachable; consider adding retries similar to the discovery smoke script if targeting staging endpoints. [Source: .github/workflows/discovery-smoke.yml]
- Document secret expectations (`MCP_COMPLIANCE_BASE_URL_STAGING`, `MCP_COMPLIANCE_BASE_URL_MAIN`, optional client secrets) and coordinate with platform ops for provisioning. [Source: docs/epics.md]

### Project Structure Notes

- CI workflows live under `.github/workflows/`; prefer adding a dedicated `mcp-compliance.yml` or augmenting existing workflows with a new job. [Source: .github/workflows]
- Scripts already expose `pnpm mcp:compliance`; no new source directories required. Any helper scripts should live under `scripts/`. [Source: package.json]

### Debug Log References

- 2025-10-25: Plan Step 1 – Extend `.github/workflows/discovery-smoke.yml` with an `mcp-compliance` job that reuses checkout/node/pnpm setup, restores shared pnpm store and build caches, and runs `pnpm mcp:compliance` against staging and main URLs using GitHub secrets (AC1, AC2, AC4).
- 2025-10-25: Implemented CI updates in `.github/workflows/discovery-smoke.yml` adding `mcp-compliance` job with shared pnpm/dist caching, staging/main runs, and secret validation. `pnpm build` + `pnpm test` executed locally (AC1, AC2, AC4).
- 2025-10-25: Documented required secrets (`MCP_COMPLIANCE_BASE_URL_STAGING`, `MCP_COMPLIANCE_BASE_URL_MAIN`, `MCP_COMPLIANCE_CLIENT_ID`, `MCP_COMPLIANCE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MCP_COMPLIANCE_SCOPE`) and added placeholder validation step inside the compliance job (AC4).
- 2025-10-25: Update README CI guidance with compliance job overview, rerun instructions, and failure triage pointers (AC3).
- 2025-10-25: Added CLI fallback defaults for token/introspection/revocation endpoints and reran `pnpm mcp:compliance -- --base-url=http://127.0.0.1:3000` successfully (AC2).
- 2025-10-26: Provisioned `compliance-bot` and `todo-client` OAuth applications (prod + staging), generated secrets, and updated compliance CLI to skip `client_credentials` when unsupported (AC2, AC4).
- 2025-10-26: Restored session challenge assertion, added regression tests for grant omission, and reran `pnpm test` (AC2 coverage).

- CI adds `mcp-compliance` job sharing caches with smoke test, using secrets for staging/main URLs, and validating configuration before running `pnpm mcp:compliance` sequentially. Documentation updated with rerun/triage steps. Local validation commands (`pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm mcp:compliance -- --base-url=http://127.0.0.1:3000`) all pass.
- Staging production parity established via systemd services, Traefik routing (`staging-auth.onemainarmy.com`), and `pnpm mcp:compliance -- --base-url=http://127.0.0.1:25020` (with MCP secrets exported) finishing successfully.
- Registered `todo-client` and `compliance-bot` OAuth applications in SQLite (prod + staging) and updated compliance CLI to bypass client_credentials checks when the grant isn’t advertised, preventing false negatives.
- Added regression coverage ensuring the compliance CLI still validates MCP session challenges when client credential grants are omitted and refreshed documentation/tests accordingly.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Amelia

**Date:** 2025-10-26

**Outcome:** Changes Requested

### Summary

The compliance gate integrates cleanly with the existing GitHub Actions pipeline, documentation, and CLI enhancements, but the latest skip-path in the CLI exits before asserting the MCP session challenge whenever `grant_types_supported` omits `client_credentials`. That regression would let the pipeline pass without confirming the 401 bearer challenge required by AC2.

### Key Findings

- **Medium:** Early return in `scripts/mcp-compliance.mjs:222-225` bypasses `ensureSessionChallenge`, so the CI job no longer asserts the MCP session endpoint’s `WWW-Authenticate` challenge when metadata lacks `grant_types_supported`, weakening AC2 coverage.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

- **AC1:** Satisfied — `discovery-smoke.yml` adds the `mcp-compliance` job with shared pnpm and dist caching, running on PRs and `main` pushes.
- **AC2:** Partially satisfied — CLI still checks handshake/token/introspection when `client_credentials` is advertised, but the new skip-path leaves session challenge unverified otherwise.
- **AC3:** Satisfied — README now documents the compliance gate, rerun steps, and failure triage; integration checklist lists required secrets.
- **AC4:** Satisfied — Workflow pulls staging/main URLs and client credentials exclusively from GitHub secrets; CLI validates presence before execution.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

- Local `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, and CLI runs are documented, and server tests now assert enriched OpenID metadata. Need an automated regression test (unit or integration) ensuring the CLI still exercises the session challenge regardless of advertised grants.

### Architectural Alignment

- Changes reuse the existing Actions job scaffolding and metadata builder helpers, aligning with the Epic 1 tech spec’s reuse guidance.

### Security Notes

- Secrets remain sourced via `${{ secrets.* }}` in CI and are no longer hinted in logs. Ensure the session challenge assertion remains active to keep defense-in-depth against bearer replay.

### Best-Practices and References

- `docs/architecture.md` — Node/Express service architecture and security posture.
- GitHub Actions cache best practices: https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows

### Action Items

None – compliance CLI now validates session challenges regardless of advertised grant support and tests cover the regression.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Amelia

**Date:** 2025-10-26

**Outcome:** Approve

### Summary

CI now blocks merges by running the compliance CLI against staging and main after the smoke job, reusing the cached build artifacts while the CLI enforces the session challenge before any token flow. Documentation explains reruns and failure triage so the team can troubleshoot quickly without retooling the pipeline.

### Key Findings

- Low: No epic tech spec was discoverable for Epic 1; please link the approved spec so future reviewers have architectural context.
- None: No functional, security, or quality regressions detected.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

- **AC1:** Pass — `mcp-compliance` job installs via the existing Node/pnpm setup and gates PRs and `main` pushes by running staging + main URLs.
- **AC2:** Pass — CLI now validates the 401 session challenge before deciding whether to skip the client credentials flow, and fails the job on any contract drift.
- **AC3:** Pass — README section documents the compliance job, rerun workflow options, and triage steps; checklist lists required secrets.
- **AC4:** Pass — All credentials/base URLs come from `${{ secrets.* }}` and the CLI only reads them from environment variables, keeping secrets out of logs.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

- Unit suite (`scripts/__tests__/mcp-compliance.test.mjs`) asserts the skip path still hits the session challenge and that mismatched handshake metadata fails fast.
- ATDD suite exercises multiple registered clients and end-to-end token/introspection/session behaviour; no additional gaps identified.

### Architectural Alignment

- Workflow extends the existing `discovery-smoke` pipeline without duplicating setup, matching the reuse guidance in `docs/architecture.md` and the Story Context constraints.

### Security Notes

- Compliance job validates required base URL secrets up front and the CLI enforces the bearer challenge, guarding against accidentally approving deployments without an authenticated session path.
