### Detailed Mapping

#### AC-1: `src/mcp/registry.ts` stores MCP client entries with required fields validated via Zod (P0)

- **Coverage:** FULL ✅
- **Tests:**
  - `config-mcp-default-scopes` – `src/__tests__/config.mcp.test.mjs:44`
    - **Given:** Default scopes declared in env
    - **When:** `loadMcpConfig` parses `MCP_CLIENTS`
    - **Then:** Clients inherit validated default scope set and scope catalog is deduped
  - `registry-lookup-helpers` – `src/__tests__/mcp.registry.test.mjs:54`
    - **Given:** Registry initialised from config
    - **When:** Client lookup by id/origin executes
    - **Then:** Stored client shape and scope catalog match schema requirements
  - `registry-reload-from-env` – `src/__tests__/mcp.registry.test.mjs:93`
    - **Given:** Updated env payload with refreshed scope list
    - **When:** `reloadMcpRegistryFromEnvironment` runs
    - **Then:** Registry reflects new metadata without rebuild errors

#### AC-2: `/.well-known/mcp-servers.json` lists registered MCP servers with handshake and session URLs (P0)

- **Coverage:** FULL ✅
- **Tests:**
  - `servers-metadata-happy-path` – `src/__tests__/server.test.mjs:190`
    - **Given:** Registry contains `todo-client`
    - **When:** Supertest hits `/.well-known/mcp-servers.json`
    - **Then:** Response schema validates and handshake/session URLs are fully qualified
  - `cli-compliance-success` – `scripts/__tests__/mcp-compliance.test.mjs:90`
    - **Given:** Stub server returns registry document and handshake metadata
    - **When:** Compliance CLI runs against base URL
    - **Then:** CLI reports success after verifying server list and endpoints

#### AC-3: `/.well-known/openid-configuration` advertises MCP extensions (P0)

- **Coverage:** FULL ✅
- **Tests:**
  - `openid-mcp-extension` – `src/__tests__/server.test.mjs:156`
    - **Given:** Better Auth app initialised with MCP registry
    - **When:** Request hits `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
    - **Then:** Response includes `mcp_session_endpoint`, `mcp_handshake_endpoint`, `mcp_scopes_supported`, and servers metadata URL
  - `cli-compliance-success` – `scripts/__tests__/mcp-compliance.test.mjs:90`
    - **Given:** CLI reads `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
    - **When:** TypeBox validation runs inside compliance script
    - **Then:** MCP extensions are required and enforced before test passes

#### AC-4: Updating the registry refreshes discovery metadata without restarting the server (P1)

- **Coverage:** FULL ✅
- **Tests:**
  - `registry-refresh-scope-catalog` – `src/__tests__/mcp.registry.test.mjs:65`
    - **Given:** Registry already initialised with baseline client
    - **When:** `reloadMcpRegistry` applies updated config with new scopes and client
    - **Then:** In-memory registry and scope catalog refresh without reboots
  - `cli-handshake-mismatch` – `scripts/__tests__/mcp-compliance.test.mjs:151`
    - **Given:** Compliance CLI reads refreshed handshake metadata
    - **When:** Returned clientId mismatches registry entry
    - **Then:** CLI fails fast, proving refresh logic is observable without server restart

---

### Duplicate Coverage Check

- No redundant overlap detected. Unit tests cover validation/control-path logic, while integration + CLI automation validate runtime exposure. Patterns align with `selective-testing.md` guidance.

---

### Quality Observations

- Tests follow deterministic patterns (no hard waits); CLI harness uses stub server to avoid network flakiness. (`test-quality.md`)
- Risk priorities (P0/P1) align with authentication exposure; all covered with executable tests. (`test-priorities-matrix.md`)
- Registry refresh validated without service restart, mitigating operational risk. (`risk-governance.md`)
- No probability-impact escalations remain; all criteria scored GREEN post coverage. (`probability-impact.md`)

---

## PHASE 2: QUALITY GATE DECISION

### Execution Evidence

- `pnpm test` → PASS (30 tests, 0 failures, 0 skipped) on 2025-10-24.
- Coverage applies to all P0 criteria (registry integrity, discovery metadata, OpenID extensions).
- No NFR regressions or flaky re-runs observed during local execution.

### Decision Thresholds

| Metric                | Threshold | Observed |
| --------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| P0 Coverage           | 100%      | 100%     |
| P0 Pass Rate          | 100%      | 100%     |
| P1 Coverage           | ≥90%      | 100%     |
| Overall Coverage      | ≥80%      | 100%     |
| Overall Test Passrate | ≥95%      | 100%     |

All deterministic thresholds met.

### Gate Decision

**Decision:** PASS ✅

**Rationale:**

1. All P0/P1 acceptance criteria validated by executable tests across unit, integration, and CLI layers.
2. Compliance CLI proves discovery surface continues to fail-safe on metadata drift, satisfying refresh requirement.
3. No open risk items or blocker defects remain; registry refresh path observable without restart.

### Next Actions

**Immediate Actions (next 24-48h):** None required.

**Follow-up Actions (next sprint):** Continue monitoring compliance CLI in CI to guard regressions.

**Stakeholder Communication:** Share PASS decision with PM/SM/DEV to proceed with downstream deployment tasks.
